This surge in energy prices was attributed to the invasion itself and also led to an increase in overall inflation due to the dynamics of energy prices and supply bottlenecks. As a result of the surging energy prices, economic activity was affected, particularly non-energy industrial goods inflation, as high energy prices had a broader impact on consumer prices. Additionally, economic activity recovered with increased energy demand."

The war affected energy markets, leading to increased energy prices, which in turn contributed to supply disruptions and influenced the euro area economy. Furthermore, these disruptions in global supply chains affected trade, and Euro area countries experienced a rise in inflation. The conflict also had direct impacts on the food sector, causing food prices to increase. As a result, inflation was associated with the effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prompting euro area governments to implement inflation compensation measures."
