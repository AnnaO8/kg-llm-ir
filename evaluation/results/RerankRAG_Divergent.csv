1. **Debt levels** in the euro area were compared to pre-pandemic levels, indicating a potential increase in public and private debt.
2. **Real GDP** in the euro area was noted to be below the pre-pandemic level, highlighting an economic contraction or slower recovery.
3. **Corporate bond spreads** exhibited stability when compared to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the risk perception among investors had stabilized.
4. **Budget deficits** were compared with pre-pandemic levels, which likely reflects the fiscal responses to the economic challenges posed by the pandemic.
5. **Financing conditions** were affected across euro area countries, indicating variations in access to capital and borrowing costs.

Overall, these elements demonstrate how the financial landscape in the euro area has shifted during and after the pandemic relative to the conditions before it."
