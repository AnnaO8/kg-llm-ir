Fiscal positions may affect contingent liabilities, which are linked to government guarantees and loan guarantee schemes. During the review period, the euro area experienced increased sovereign bond yields and corporate bond spreads, showing a widening trend. Additionally, the economic indicators such as PMIs saw a collapse in March, reflecting adverse financial conditions.

The convergence related to fiscal positions suggests that these initial conditions not only influenced liquidity measures but also affected the broader economic landscape, with underlying inflation dynamics consistently reflecting this convergence. The expectation of convergence was tied to the inflation outlook, indicating a relationship between fiscal health and inflationary pressures within the Euro area. Overall, the response of financial conditions appears to be intricately linked to the fiscal positions of Member States, with implications for government guarantees and market dynamics."

In relation to future short-term rates, contact-intensive activities like food services are sensitive to fluctuations in demand, which can be influenced by the broader economic conditions shaped by the exchange rate. As the economic activity experiences changes (such as improvements or contractions), this can lead to adjustments in short-term rates which, in turn, affect the food services industry.
