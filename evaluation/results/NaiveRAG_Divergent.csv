These measures have prevented not only fluctuations in energy prices but also the associated distributional and macroeconomic implications that such fluctuations can create. Additionally, the energy mix and country characteristics are crucial factors that influence developments in electricity prices."

While corporate insolvencies are countercyclical to real GDP growth and tend to lag behind economic performance, the interaction of fixed costs that remain unaddressed can lead to firm insolvency. However, the context indicates that policy measures resulted in corporate insolvency cases, suggesting a complex relationship influenced by economic conditions and costs faced by firms."
