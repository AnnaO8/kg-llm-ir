In particular, the Council is concerned with primary risks regarding exchange rate movements, which are expected to influence inflation in the medium term. Fiscal support measures are implemented to aid vulnerable countries, which helps in sustaining their economic recovery and can forestall fiscal contraction. This support is particularly pertinent given the high energy inflation observed in the euro area, which is expected to have significant impacts on economic activity and inflation rates.

The measures to address high energy inflation and associated economic uncertainties underscore the importance of fiscal support, which is linked to economic recovery and debt sustainability among vulnerable countries, especially those affected by the COVID-19 crisis.

Regarding recommendations for the end of this year, it is implied that continuing fiscal support is essential to mitigate risks around inflation movements tied to exchange rates and to foster economic recovery across different countries. Thus, maintaining and potentially enhancing these fiscal support measures would be advisable as these elements are interconnected and crucial for overall economic stability."

The invasion caused a rise in energy prices which in turn affects consumer prices and is related to the overall implications on the global supply chain.

In terms of trade policy, this situation highlights the interconnectedness of energy commodities and agricultural products like wheat; for example, energy prices significantly impact the pricing and availability of wheat, as energy is required for farming and transportation. The context implies that as energy prices increase due to the invasion, it could lead to higher prices and reduced availability of wheat, affecting global supply chains.

Overall, the U.S. response seems to involve considerations of how rising energy prices, triggered by the invasion, could lead to significant impacts on agricultural imports and trade dynamics, particularly regarding wheat."
