Higher energy prices often lead to increased revenues for energy-exporting countries and sectors, which can stimulate economic growth. Additionally, the uncertainty caused by the invasion can prompt government spending and investment in domestic industries aimed at mitigating energy dependence. Together, these factors indicate a complex relationship where the effects of higher energy prices and economic uncertainty could contribute to economic growth in certain contexts."
